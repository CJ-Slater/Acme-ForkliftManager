1. Run the solution in your chosen IDE. Ensure that the API is running on 'http://localhost:7127/' as that is what the forklift user portal is expecting.
2. There is a Swagger API available for testing endpoints or setting of obstacles, otherwise you can use the Forklift User Portal to use the application.
